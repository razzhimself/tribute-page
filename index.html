          <h3>Musicianship</h3>
          <p>
            Kurt Donald Cobain (February 20, 1967 â€“ April 5, 1994) was an
            American singer-songwriter and musician, best known as the
            guitarist, primary songwriter and frontman of the rock band Nirvana.
            Through his angst-fueled songwriting and anti-establishment persona,
            Cobain's compositions widened the thematic conventions of mainstream
            rock music. He was often heralded as a spokesman of Generation X and
            is considered to be one of the most influential musicians in the
            history of alternative rock.

          <h3>Nirvana</h3>
          <p>
            Born in Aberdeen, Washington, Cobain formed the band Nirvana with
            Krist Novoselic and Aaron Burckhard in 1987 and established it as
            part of the Seattle music scene which later became known as grunge.
            After signing with major label DGC Records, Nirvana found global
            success with "Smells Like Teen Spirit" from their critically
            acclaimed second album Nevermind (1991). Although Cobain was hailed
            as the voice of his generation following Nirvana's sudden success,
            he resented this, believing his message and artistic vision had been
            misinterpreted by the public. In addition to "Smells Like Teen
            Spirit", Cobain wrote many notable songs for Nirvana, including
            "About a Girl", "In Bloom", "Come as You Are", "Lithium", "Polly",
            "Something in the Way", "All Apologies", and "Heart-Shaped

          <h3>Mental Health</h3>
          <p>
            During the last years of his life, Cobain struggled with heroin
            addiction and chronic health problems such as depression. He also
            struggled with the personal and professional pressures of fame, as
            well as his marriage to musician Courtney Love.[2] In March 1994,
            Cobain overdosed on a combination of champagne and Rohypnol, and
            subsequently entered an intervention and underwent a detox program.
            On April 8, 1994, Cobain was found dead at his home in Seattle at
            the age of 27; police concluded he had died on April 5 from a
            self-inflicted shotgun wound to the head.

          <h3>Achievements</h3>
          <p>
            Cobain was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of
            Fame, along with Nirvana bandmates Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl,
            in their first year of eligibility in 2014. Rolling Stone included
            Cobain in its lists of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, 100
            Greatest Guitarists, and 100 Greatest Singers of All Time. He was
            ranked 7th by MTV in the "22 Greatest Voices in Music". In 2006, he
            was placed 20th by Hit Parader on their list of the "100 Greatest
            Metal Singers of All Time".
